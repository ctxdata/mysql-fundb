/** @file ha_fun.h

    @brief
  The ha_fun engine is a stubbed storage engine for fun purposes only;
  it does nothing at this point. Its purpose is to provide a source
  code illustration of how to begin writing new storage engines; see also
  /storage/fun/ha_fun.cc.

    @note
  Please read ha_fun.cc before reading this file.
  Reminder: The fun storage engine implements all methods that are
  *required* to be implemented. For a full list of all methods that you can
  implement, see handler.h.

   @see
  /sql/handler.h and /storage/fun/ha_fun.cc
